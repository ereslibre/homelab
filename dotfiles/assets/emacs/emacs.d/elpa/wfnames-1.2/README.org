#+TITLE: Wfnames

Allows editing filenames.

* Features

Allows editing lists of absolute files, this allows editing the
directory parts as well.

Modified lines are highlighted, maybe in a different color when about
to overwrite an existing file.

File completion is provided.

Not tighted to a directory, allows editing files from various
directories.

Do not provide edition of permissions and will not.

* Motivation

Wdired must be patched to allow editing a list of absolute filenames
in Emacs versions before Emacs-29.
Also Wdired depends on a default directory which is not relevant and
prone to errors when editing absolute filenames that come from various
directories.
Using this package in Helm allows getting rid of Wdired advices (that have
been merged in Emacs-29+).

* Install

This package have no user interface, but you can easily use it with
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] package by customizing =helm-ff-edit-marked-files-fn= variable.
If you are not using [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] you will have to define yourself a function
that call =wfnames-setup-buffer= with a list of files as argument.

* Usage

Once in the Wfnames buffer, edit your filenames and hit =C-c C-c= to
save your changes. You have completion on filenames and directories
with =TAB= but if you are using [[https://github.com/victorhge/iedit][Iedit]] package and it is in action use =M-TAB=.
