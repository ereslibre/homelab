* NEWS
** Version 4.0.4
*** Rewrite the helm async process filter
*** We can now mark the <n> next candidates with a numeric prefix arg
Same for previous.
*** Change default prefix binding to reach nth candidates
Now you can reach next nth candidate with C-<n> and previous nth
candidate with M-<n>, it is easier to remember.
*** helm-completions-detailed is now enabled by default
** Version 4.0.3
*** New drag-and-drop support for helm-find-files (only Emacs-29+)
Use now dnd.el for the new drag-and-drop function.
This allows drag-and-drop in external applications in addition to emacs
dired frames and windows. See helm-find-files documentation.
*** Remove old drag-and-drop support for helm-find-files
*** Add a new completion metadata category command-help
Handle helm-M-x prefix arg integration in this category.  That's mean
you can have helm-M-x prefix arg in M-X.
*** Allow filtering sources in current session
It is bound to C-M-e in helm-map.
*** Change `helm-current-directory-alist` default value
Now C-x C-f from a Gnus buffer brings to News directory.
*** Exclude commands related to specific modes in helm-M-x
This is available only in Emacs with an interactive version supporting
MODES argument.  It is configurable with
`helm-M-x-exclude-unusable-commands-in-mode`, default to t.
*** Fix preselection after persistent killing buffers
*** Improve colors in ttys
*** Add new actions to helm-find-files
*** Fix require-match in completion-in-region
** Version 4.0.2
*** Fix Emacs bug with CRM when using org-set-tags
*** Improve helm-source-files-in-current-dir
*** Fix some compatibility problems with EIEIO in various Emacs
*** Improve helm-projects-history
*** Fix bug in recentf
Properties may corrupt recentf data, prevent this.
*** Fix bug with *-window-side-state no more working
*** Remove the ability of switching to recursive search with C-j in HFF
It was broken and not needed as we can just add the final "/" to expand.
*** Change default value of `helm-locate-recursive-dirs-command'
It is no more using `locate` but `find`, this because locate is not
working anymore out of the box without some tweaks (plocate backend).
It is still anyway the faster alternative once tweaked, see HFF
documentation.
*** Improve position of helm frame
*** Provide icons in find and fdfind
** Version 4.0.1
*** Provide icons in some more places (helm-for-files.el)
*** Package-vc-* commands have now affixations (package category)
*** Show only basename of dot files in helm-find-files
It is now the default, but it can be configured with `helm-ff-show-dot-file-path`.
*** Allow using both all-the-icons and nerd-icons as icon providers
Use the variable `helm-x-icons-provider`.
*** Add affixations to helm-info
Add a description of info file when using `helm-info` or `info-display-manual`.
*** Provide minimal support for eww bookmarks
*** Stop preventing dups when trashing files
*** Add a helm-add-to-list function for user init file settings
*** Drop support for deprecated defadvice management
*** Allow destructuring in helm-acase
*** Popup-info can be provided in metadata and added to any completion
via the vars `helm-completing-read-command-categories` and
`helm-completing-read-extra-metadata`, for example it is now enabled
in M-x man.
*** Maybe provide a popup-info in completion-at-point
If CAPFns provide such information via `completion-extra-properties`,
display it in a popup-info when helm-popup-tip-mode is enabled.
`helm-lisp-completion-at-point` provides this as well.
*** Add completion for Char Classes for regexps
This is available in `helm-lisp-completion-at-point`.
*** Enhance usage of tab-bar-mode from Helm
Previously we were displaying each marked candidate in a tab, now all
marked candidates go in same tab.
Helm-find-files is now using the same functions as helm-buffers to
display its candidates in tab.
helm-imenu-all when jumping to a candidate jump to it in its tab if
possible.
*** Access to helm-find-files bookmarks from helm-read-file-name
That's mean that when copying/renaming etc... you can use bookmarks as
target.
*** Fix a bug in query replace in file names
It is now possible to match counter ("\#") inside the replacement
string and not only before or after as before.
*** Fix a bug with dummy sources in file related sources
It is now possible to mark wildcard candidates from unrelated
directories.
** Version 4.0
*** Enhance helm-finder
Now helm-finder fetchs keywords from all packages, not only built-in
and allows installing from there.
*** helm-popup-tip-mode is now usable in any source having the popup-info attribute
In addition of the various helm-grep-* now =helm-man-woman= and
=helm-find-files= can benefit of this mode.
*** New command helm-outline to navigate buffers according to outline-regexp
*** New helm grep ag action to search results from the helm ag/rg session
This allows filtering the current results to another pattern or to
specific file.
*** New helm grep ag action to launch ag/rg on parent directory of current search
*** Packages can now be (re)installed/upgraded asynchronously from helm-packages
It is now the default, you can customize this with =helm-packages-async=.
*** Helm-find-files persistent delete uses now a read-answer prompt
It is now possible to answer "!" (yes for all) when using marked
candidates, this for the file deletion itself and also for the kill
buffer question.
*** Allow saving selection when deleting minibuffer contents
This is now possible with a prefix arg given when position is at eol
in minibuffer.  This allow for example showing all candidates keeping
current selection in helm-ls-git log after a search.
*** Save files opened from etags and fd in file-name-history
*** Provide help in helm-read-answer
*** Disable helm for read-multiple-choice--long-answers
** Version 3.9.9
*** Change prefix arg behavior of helm-show-all-candidates-in-source
With a prefix arg show all candidates, with a numeric prefix arg show
ARG number of candidates, and with no prefix arg show only
helm-candidate-number-limit of candidates.
*** Get rid of popup.el dependency
*** helm-completion-styles-alist accepts commands for completion-in-region
*** Minibuffer-contents change color in HFF when updating
This is controlled by =helm-ff-dim-prompt-on-update= user variable.

*** Now new file and dir have a dummy source in HFF, same for completing-read's
and read-file-name.

*** helm-info-at-point shows index of current page in addition of default

So it can safely be used as a replacement of "i" in Info.

*** Add affixation function for eww (emacs-30 only)
*** Allow toggling auto update in helm-top with a prefix arg
*** Do not use `dired-create-destination-dirs` mechanism for directory creation
as it is not working in some cases (e.g. symlinks).
*** Fix persistent action in helm mark-ring when follow mode is on
*** Fix Imenu preselection when point is on a name with special chars
*** Provide a new progress bar for rsync with a svg widget
Needs svg-lib package but it is not mandatory.

** Version 3.9.8

*** New helm-finder command
*** Make `completions-detailed` working with 'emacs' helm-completion-style
It was already working but was really slow and was not supporting
`helm-completing-read-command-categories` mechanism which provide
`completions-detailed` in much more places than Emacs vanilla.
*** Helm-goto-line save position even when using persistent actions
*** helm-info is now colorized
*** Displaying thumnails is now slighly faster
*** Add a new mode to edit bookmark annotations
When viewing an annotation you had to kill the buffer, restart
helm-bookmarks, and run the edit annotation action, now you can edit
directly from the view buffer.
*** It is now possible to rename marked bookmarks
*** New compress/uncompress/compress-to action in helm-find-files
All actions are asynchronous except the persistent ones.
*** Allow toggling while-no-input for easier edebugging
Use the new `helm-update-edebug` variable to enable this.
*** And various bug fixes as always

** Version 3.9.7

*** Fix package-requires in helm.el

** Version 3.9.6

*** Fix bug with helm-mm-exact-search (bug#2616)
*** Improve locate library fns
*** Fix a old bug with candidate transformer
candidate-transformer functions should behave the same in in-buffer
and sync source: transforming all candidates.
*** Fix kmacro for Emacs-29+
*** Various minor bug fixes

** Version 3.9.5

*** Add compatibility with Emacs-28< for helm-packages

Tested with emacs-27.

*** Add new action package-isolate for helm-packages

Allow launching a new Emacs with only package(s).

*** Packages list can be refreshed with C-c C-u

BTW there is no more option to update from actions with prefix arg.

*** Add more affixations fns for completing-read

Themes, colors etc...

*** Add new var helm-compleions-detailed for emacs-27

This allow using completions-detailed in Emacs-27 with various
describe-* functions.

*** Helm-occur now doesn't hang when trying to match empty lines

With "^$".

*** Highlight matches in M-x highlight only commands

I.e. Items in short documentation are not highlighted.

** Version 3.9.4

*** Add two new alists to allow extending completions-detailed

This allows providing detailed completions in more places, see
`helm-completing-read-extra-metadata` and
`helm-completing-read-command-categories`.
They are not provided as user variables as it may be tricky to provide
the corresponding affixations functions.
As of now we have detailed completions in
describe-function/variable/symbol/command/package,
find-function/variable, switch-to-buffer,
customize-variable/group, package-(vc)install, package-vc-checkout.

*** New helm packages manager

The old helm-elisp-package has been replaced by helm-packages.
The old one was too slow, taking lot of memory and even crashing Emacs
especially with last Emacs-29.

** Version 3.9.3

*** Ensure to use affixation functions provided by caller in helm-mode

** Version 3.9.2

*** New progress bar for Rsync action from helm-find-files
*** Describe-* commands with completions-detailed are now fast
*** Use Wfnames package as dependency to replace Wdired

** Version 3.9.1

*** helm-config file has been removed

Therefore (require 'helm-config) will return an error, don't use this
anymore. If installing from source use instead (require 'helm-autoloads), otherwise from a package install, the autoloads file
will be automatically loaded.


*** Allow using helm-completion-styles-alist by command

*** New mode for editing large vars

Will be used automatically when using the set variable action from
helm-apropos.

*** Improve all-the-icons in many places
